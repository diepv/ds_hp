This experiment includes several commercial HD video cameras aimed at the earth which are enclosed in a pressurized and temperature controlled housing.  Video from these cameras is transmitted back to earth and also streamed live on this channel. While the experiment is operational, views will typically sequence though the different cameras. Between camera switches, a gray and then black color slate will briefly appear. Since the ISS is in darkness during part of each orbit, the images will be dark at those times.
